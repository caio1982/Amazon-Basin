Amazon Wishlist
===============

Python version of the old and buggy Perl module WWW::Amazon::Wishlist. It's written using LXML and XPaths for better readability and so far I guarantee it works fine with 2.6 in OSX.

This is my first attempt in writing a Python module so bear with me as you find something not really looking pythonic. It supports the Amazon stores in the US, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Japan and China. I'm still behind testing them all, though.

TODO
====

* Write a scrapper using only someone's e-mail address
* Normalize all returns to the same type, if possible
* Shorten the longest XPaths (minor, just prettyfication)
* Some coded tests would be good...
