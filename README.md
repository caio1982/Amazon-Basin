Amazon Wishlist
===============

Python version of the old and buggy Perl module WWW::Amazon::Wishlist.

This is my first attempt in writing a Python module so bear with me as you find something not really looking pythonic. It supports the Amazon stores in the US, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Japan and China. I'm still behind testing them all, though.

TODO
====

* Write a scrapper using only someone's e-mail address
* Write a method or function that returns the total of prices
* Normalize all returns to the same type, if possible
* Add a minimal documentation to every function/method/class
* Shorten the longest xpaths (minor, just prettyfication)
* Some coded tests would be good...
