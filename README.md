Amazon Wishlist
===============

Python version of the old and buggy Perl module WWW::Amazon::Wishlist.

TODO
====

* Write a scrapper using only someone's e-mail address
* Write a method or function that returns the total of prices
* Make the config parsing generic, avoid calling it twice
* Normalize all returns to the same type, if possible
* Add a minimal documentation to every function/method/class
* Shorten the longest xpaths (minor, just prettyfication)
